In data science, we often deal with such matrices, be it in the context of network analysis and graph mining (where each non-existing link leads to a zero entry in the adjacency matrix) or when we we deal with matrices capturing similarity scores (where zero entries indicate objects that are either not similar or for which the similarty is not known).\n","\n","Clearly, it is not efficient to perform mathematical operations on matrices where the majority of entries is zero anyway. The module `scipy.sparse` thus offers classes to represent such matrices. The class `csr_matrix` (CSR = Compressed Sparse Row) for instance can be initialised from a list of `python` lists or, conveniently, from a `numpy` array. As we see below, different from a `numpy` array, the class `csr_matrix` only stores the non-zero entries of the matrix:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[[1. 0. 1.]\n"," [0. 1. 0.]\n"," [0. 0. 1.]]\n","  (0, 0)\t1.0\n","  (0, 2)\t1.0\n","  (1, 1)\t1.0\n","  (2, 2)\t1.0\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import scipy.sparse\n","\n","matrix = np.array([[1., 0., 1.], [0., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 1.]])\n","print(matrix)\n","\n","sparse_matrix = scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(matrix)\n","sparse_matrix\n","print(sparse_matrix)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["If we wish to recover a representation with zeros, we can call the `to_dense` method on an instance of `csr_matrix`.
