    "# Representing networks with `pathpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "*October 27 2021*\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorials covered in the previous week covered the basics of data science with `python`. With this out of the way, we now introduce `pathpy`, a network analysis and visualisation package that is being actively developed at my chair. If you are interested to participate in the development of this OpenSource project, you can either sign up for the \"eXtended AI Lab\" or apply for a position as student assistant in our group. For more information, please refer to our website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from being developed in our group `pathpy` has a couple of advantages compared to many other network analysis packages. First, it is easy to install as it has no dependencies that are not included in a default `anaconda` installation and it is a pure `python` package that does not require compilation. Second, `pathpy` has a user-friendly API that makes it easy to handle directed and undirected networks, networks with single and multiple edges, multi-layer networks, temporal networks, as well as networks with arbitrary node, edge or graph-level attributes. Third, it provides interactive HTML visualisations that can be directly displayed inside `jupyter` notebooks, making it particularly suitable for educational settings. And finally, different from other packages it directly supports the analysis and visualisation of time series data on networked systems, such as time-stamped edges or data on paths in networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we first import `pathpy` and assign the local alias `pp`:"
