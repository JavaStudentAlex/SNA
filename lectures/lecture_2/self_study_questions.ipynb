If the edge between i-node and j-node exists and the edge between j and k exists we can say that we traversed walk with length 2. Then the A ^ 3 = A ^ 2 * A, so imagine in A ^ 2 we have already had i - j - k connection but in the A there is also k - m connection, and it means that the connection i - j - k - m exists with length 3. And so on with every power. It means that power of the matrix k is the matrix where each cell Aij means the number of routes from j to j with length k."
